## Guidelines

1. **Update Meetings**
   * Each project team will have a 1â€“1.5 hour meeting weekly/bi-weekly (e.g., Saturday evenings â€” exact time to be finalized per team).  
   * Attendance is expected unless notified in advance.

2. **Task Assignment & Deadlines**
   * Clear tasks and deadlines will be assigned by supervisors or team leads.  
   * Submit code, reports, or findings in the designated folder or platform (e.g., Google Drive, GitHub) on time.

3. **Communication**
   * Stay active in your projectâ€™s communication channel (e.g., Discord or Classroom).  
   * Use threads, tags, or channels to keep discussions organized and accessible.  
   * Regular updates help everyone stay aligned and resolve issues quickly.

4. **Responsibility & Exit**
   * If a participant is inactive without notice for 7+ days, they may be considered inactive and tasks may be reassigned.  
   * Please inform your team in advance if you are temporarily unavailable.

5. **Authorship**
   * All contributions will be tracked and discussed upfront to ensure transparency.  
   * **Code contributions** should be made via our GitHub organization: [AI/ML Professional Community Bangladesh](https://github.com/aimlcommunitybd). Commits, pull requests, and issues will document participation.  
   * **Documentation, reports, and written work** should be submitted in designated folders or collaborative platforms (e.g., Google Drive, GitHub wiki, Google Doc) with clear attribution.  
   * Equal effort will receive equal credit. Authorship on publications will reflect **actual contributions**, and any disputes will be discussed openly with supervisors.

6. **Code & Writing Standards**
   * Follow consistent coding practices (well-documented, reproducible).  
   * Use proper citation and writing standards; templates and tools will be shared by supervisors.

7. **Respect & Collaboration**
   * Maintain a respectful, inclusive environment.  
   * Be open to feedback and assist teammates whenever possible.  
   * Conflicts should be discussed openly and constructively, with supervisors mediating if needed.

# Research Collaboration Program 01 (July 2025)

**Purpose:**
This is a volunteer-based research collaboration program aimed at publishing quality papers in conferences and/or journals.
There is **no funding or payment** involved ‚Äî the initiative is **open to all**, but teams will be formed based on experience and skills.

#### üë• Who‚Äôs Behind This Program & Why It Exists

This research initiative is led by the **AI/ML Professional Community Bangladesh** ‚Äî a volunteer-driven, non-profit group committed to building a stronger local AI/ML ecosystem. We offer free, accessible programs to support learners, practitioners, and researchers at all levels.

Our ongoing efforts include **[ML Saturday](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6_zFMqdurBpU8jlJWujAOHnF_GXX4nEe&si=Wlj6tL8D3ZVyApBa)**, a monthly Q\&A session focused on ML learning, research guidance, and career support.

**Our broader goals include:**

* üåç **Local Networking** ‚Äì connecting students, professionals, and academics for shared growth
* üéì **Mentorship & Support** ‚Äì organizing workshops, Q\&A sessions, and mock interviews
* üîç **Research & Development** ‚Äì enabling collaborative research and helping quality publications
* üíª **Open-Source Contributions** ‚Äì promoting community-driven projects and code contributions

This program directly aligns with our **Research & Development** goal ‚Äî fostering collaboration, enhancing research skills, and guiding participants toward impactful publications within and beyond Bangladesh.

## ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions

**Q1: Can you start working on a paper just with beginners so that we can gain some experience?**  
Yes, but it is always harder and takes more time in the beginning. You need to decide if you can commit a good amount of time to it.

**Q2: Is it a job or just for collaboration?**  
This is only for collaboration, not a job.

**Q3: Are these funded projects?**  
No, these projects are not funded.

**Q4: Can we expect to get a letter of recommendation or any kind of official recognition?**  
I do not think that is possible at this stage. This is simply a group of people working together with the goal of publishing in a journal or conference.

**Q5: What will happen if the project cannot be completed in the proposed timeline?**  
If the project cannot be completed on time, we can extend the timeline or adjust the publication plan. From my experience, the type of projects I have planned should not take more than two months if we work on them regularly, but the timeline is not strictly fixed. 

**Q6: Is dataset collection and annotation complete? If not, is two months enough for a journal publication?**  
For some projects, the dataset collection is complete. For others, it will take additional time.

**Q7: Do you provide any remuneration?**  
No.

**Q8: What opportunities for growth and learning can I expect by joining your team?**  
You will gain practical experience working on research projects with people who share an interest in publishing. It is an opportunity to strengthen your academic portfolio with potential publications.

**Q9: What is the process for determining authorship order in your team‚Äôs publications?**  
Authorship order will be based on the level and quality of each member‚Äôs contribution. We will discuss and agree on this at the start of the project when tasks are assigned. If authorship order is important to you, you should consider taking the lead role in that project to secure a higher position.

**Q10: How does the team approach ethical considerations in research, particularly with AI/ML systems?**  
We follow responsible AI practices. If you have specific ethical concerns, we can address and resolve them when we begin working together.

**Q11: What are your goals by the end of this year? Are you planning to work on a research paper or conference paper?**  
The goal is to publish a few journal papers. This will depend on how many teams are formed and how many successfully complete their work.

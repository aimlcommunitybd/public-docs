## ðŸ“‹ Research Program Guidelines (Draft)

> ðŸ”— *All participants are expected to follow our [Community Code of Conduct](https://github.com/aimlcommunitybd/public-docs/blob/main/legal/code-of-conduct.md) to ensure a respectful and collaborative environment.*

To keep things smooth and fair for everyone:

1. **Weekly Meetings:**

   * Each project team will have a 1â€“1.5 hour meeting every week (e.g., Saturday evenings â€” time to be finalized per team).
   * Attendance is expected unless notified in advance.

2. **Task Assignment & Deadlines:**

   * Clear tasks and deadlines will be assigned.
   * Submit code, reports, or findings in the designated folder or platform (e.g., Google Drive, GitHub).

3. **Communication:**

   * Stay active in your projectâ€™s communication channel (e.g., Discord/Classroom).
   * Use threads or tags to keep discussions organized.

4. **Responsibility & Exit:**

   * If you're inactive without notice for 7+ days, weâ€™ll assume you've exited the project.
   * Please inform your team in advance if youâ€™re unavailable temporarily.

5. **Authorship Policy:**

   * Contributions will be tracked and discussed upfront.
   * Equal effort = equal credit.

6. **Code & Writing Standards:**

   * Follow consistent coding practices (well-documented, reproducible).
   * Use citation and writing standards (weâ€™ll share templates/tools).

7. **Respect & Collaboration:**

   * Maintain a respectful, inclusive environment.
   * Be open to feedback, and help teammates when possible.

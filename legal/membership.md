# 👥 Membership & Roles | AI/ML Professional Community Bangladesh

### Welcome!

This document provides an overview of how to join, participate, or support our community, and how you can contribute through various roles. All participants are expected to follow our [**Code of Conduct**](https://github.com/aimlcommunitybd/public-docs/blob/main/legal/code-of-conduct.md) — please review before getting involved! 🔗

## 1. Membership Categories

| **Membership Tier**           | **Who You Are & How You Contribute** |
|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **General Member**            | Interested in learning, attending events, and staying connected. |
| **Contributing Member**       | Active contributors — mentors, workshop instructor, content creators, project or research collaborator, community volunteers, etc. |
| **Supporting Member**         | Donors or resource providers (financial or in-kind) helping sustain community programs. |
| **Fellow / Honorary Member**  | Invited contributors recognized for long-term or exceptional impact. |

Special roles like project leads, research supervisor or organizing committee members are selected from **Contributing Members** — no separate application needed.

## 2. Strategic Advisory Panel *(Invitation Only)*

This panel is composed of respected senior professionals — professors, industry leaders, and research leaders — who offer **high‑level strategic direction for community-wide planning**.

They are _not_ involved in routine mentorship of general members. Instead, they help guide decisions such as:

- Launching major initiatives (e.g., code jams, hackathons, conferences)  
- Securing sponsorships or partnerships  
- Evaluating new programs or long-term community activities  

Think of them as **wise counsel** — offering advice, not day-to-day management or onboarding.

> ▶️ Note: Advisory Panel members are selected by invitation only.
